# streetNameProject
Inspired by a news article which showed that many street names in the USA were plant names, I decided to find out what is the most common street name in Australia. This repo is a summary of the analysis I have done.


I have presented this work at many conferences including YOW! Data, Linux Conference Australia and Pycon Australia.
