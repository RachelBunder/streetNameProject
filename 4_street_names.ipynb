    "My original motivation for this was the most common street names for many states in the USA are plant names like Cedar or Oak. I didn't think we did this in Australia - so I set out to find out. At least in Sydney, we see some plant names in the top 50:  __[Boronia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boronia)__, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose (although I think more likely to be a name), __[Waratah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waratah)__ (NSW state emblem), __[Wattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia_sensu_lato)__ (National flower of Australia) and Pine. Pine is really interesting as I don't think there are native pine trees in Sydney. Perhaps named after Norfolk pines which were introduced to Sydney early on. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, they are no where close to being the most common. Sure, this data is only for Sydney, but I doubt it will change when we look at the whole nation. Flora is diverse in Australia. Boronias and wattles are more or less nation wide, but Waratahs are only in the south east. Introduced pines are nation wide, but are mostly in state forests without many streets. And different states will then add their own native plants to the mix. A state may have a plant name as the most common street name, but I doubt there will be many in the top 10 street names nation wide. \n",
